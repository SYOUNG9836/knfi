# knfi: Analysis of Korean National Forest Inventory Database

## Overview

Understanding the current status of forest resources is essential for
monitoring changes in forest ecosystems and generating related
statistics. In South Korea, the National Forest Inventory (NFI) surveys
over 4,500 sample plots nationwide every five years and records 70
items, including forest stand, forest resource, and forest vegetation
surveys. Many researchers use NFI as the primary data for research, such
as biomass estimation or analyzing the importance value of each species
over time and space, depending on the research purpose. However, the
large volume of accumulated forest survey data from across the country
can make it challenging to manage and utilize such a vast dataset. To
address this issue, we developed an R package that efficiently handles
large-scale NFI data across time and space. The package offers a
comprehensive workflow for NFI data analysis. It starts with data
processing, where read_nfi() function reconstructs NFI data according to
the researcher’s needs while performing basic integrity checks for data
quality. Following this, the package provides analytical tools that
operate on the verified data. These include functions like summary_nfi()
for summary statistics, diversity_nfi() for biodiversity analysis,
iv_nfi() for calculating species importance value, and biomass_nfi() and
cwd_biomass_nfi() for biomass estimation. Finally, for visualization,
the tsvis_nfi() function generates graphs and maps, allowing users to
visualize forest ecosystem changes across various spatial and temporal
scales. This integrated approach and its specialized functions can
enhance the efficiency of processing and analyzing NFI data, providing
researchers with insights into forest ecosystems. The NFI Excel files
(.xlsx) are not included in the R package and must be downloaded
separately. Users can access these NFI Excel files by visiting the Korea
Forest Service Forestry Statistics Platform
(<https://kfss.forest.go.kr/stat/ptl/article/articleList.do?curMenu=11694&bbsId=microdataboard>)
to download the annual NFI Excel files, which are bundled in .zip
archives. Please note that this website is only available in Korean, and
direct download links can be found in the notes section of the
read_nfi() function.
